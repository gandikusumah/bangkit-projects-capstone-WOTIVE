Description

Shortest Route Optimization
Vehicle Routing Problem solves the problem by creating a distance dimension, which computes the cumulative distance traveled by each vehicle along its route. You can then set a cost proportional to the maximum of the total distances along each route. In setting up the problem, the distances between locations are calculated using Manhattan distance, in which the distance between two points, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is defined to be |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

Dataset
We did not find a suitable and existing dataset for our project on the internet. Hence, we build our own dataset by extracting workshop information needed on Google Maps.
